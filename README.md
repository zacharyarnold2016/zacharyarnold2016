- I make music and dabble in various artistic ventures, so alot of the work i post here will have something to do
- with either music, art pieces, photography.
- 
- Currently exploring Soundclouds and Spotify's APIs to analyze the differences in their normalizations and see if there's
- any significant impact on their audio spectrums as a result of different processing for streaming optimization
- 
- Interested in experimenting with some front end developers, currently getting a handle on React, but it's one of my weaker skills
- at the moment.
-
- Currently in my first real year of development and looking to get a better grip on the MERN stack. I'm fairly comfortable working with
- MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS
